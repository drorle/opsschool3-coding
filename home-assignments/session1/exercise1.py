# This script will do the following:
# Read an input parameter with a JSON file name (for instance my_list.json)
# The JSON will be in the following format (see below)
#
#  Dictionary that will contain one nested hash and one list
#  the hash will be of pairs of names and ages (name will be the key and age will be the value)
#  the array will be a list of ages
#
# the program will go over the list of people and divide them to buckets based on their ages
# each bucket will hold all the names of the people with age between the partition key and the following partition key
# bucket  â€˜20-25â€™ will hold a list of name that their age is between 20 and 25 (not including)
# this data will them be saved in a yaml format in a file with the same name as the input file with changed extension.
